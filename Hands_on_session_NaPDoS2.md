# Hands-on session NaPDoS2
This exercise corresponds to the tutorial example Genome tutorial A from the NaPDoS2 [documentation](https://npdomainseeker.sdsc.edu/napdos2/np2_documentation.pdf).

Genome tutorial objective
Analyze a single bacterial genome Salinispora tropica CNB-440 to uncover the unique salC KS domain, which clades separately from other KS domains and thus likely represents a novel biosynthetic class of KS (as reported in Bauman et al. Nat Chem Biol. 2022)
